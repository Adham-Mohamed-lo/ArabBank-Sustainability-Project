## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: #0E6251 (Arab Bank Thyme) - a muted, sophisticated green, evoking a sense of stability and growth.
- Secondary color: #FFFFFF (White) - used extensively for backgrounds and text to create a clean and readable interface.
- Accent color: #3498DB (Blue) - used for interactive elements and calls to action, providing a sense of trust and reliability. Incorporate the Arab Bank logo colors.
- Body and headline font: 'Cairo' (sans-serif) for a modern, objective, and neutral feel that supports Arabic script.
- Use clear, professional icons related to sustainability, finance, and data management. The style should be simple and geometric, suitable for both English and Arabic contexts.
- Clean and structured layout with a prominent sidebar for main navigation. The data entry form should use a multi-page or tabbed design to break up the information into manageable sections. Data entry and display should support Arabic language and right-to-left layouts.
- Subtle transitions and animations to enhance user experience, such as loading indicators and form validation feedback. Animation should be used sparingly to maintain a professional tone. Animations should be culturally appropriate and non-distracting.
